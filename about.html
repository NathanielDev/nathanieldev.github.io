<header>About Me:</header>
<p>Hello! My name is Nathaniel and I am a first year at Griffith College studying CS. I was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, but i lived the majority of my life in Sao Carlos, Sao Paulo, Brazil. I wrote my first "Hello world" when i was 15 and i just coudn't stop programming since then.<br> I always had a deep love for research and physics since they both help me learn more about the world we enhabit, hence my ultimate carrer goal is working with quantum computer research. It may not be the most lucrative or the safest carrer path, but since it is a mix of  computer science, physics and research so I am very determined to give it a shot.  </p>
