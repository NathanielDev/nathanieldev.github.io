<header id="1">What is the difference between the internet and the web? </header>
<p>Before we learn about how the Web functions, <strong>it is important to establish the difference between “The Internet” and “The Web”. </strong>

The internet is a global network in which a huge number of computers servers and devices are connected. This network eases the transfer of user input and data(communication) and can be accessed in a variety of ways. This data is exchanged between computers via network protocols. (1) <br><br>

<strong>The Web on the other hand is one of the parts of the internet.</strong> (2) The Web can be described as an aggregation of information which can be accessed by using the internet as a vehicle. This information is accessed via web browsers, and can be displayed in archives or web pages. The data in the web is broadcasted mainly through the HTTP protocol. </p>

<header id="2">When was the Internet Created?</header> 
<p><strong>The US government was responsible for the first iteration of the internet in the 1960’s, but it wasn’t like the world wide web we use Today.</strong> It was just a network involving a few of their computers and was not available publicly. This early version of the internet could only exchange simple bits of information. In 1985 they developed a network backbone that was to be used mainly in universities. <strong>This era of the internet can be described as the pre-world wide web internet.</strong> </p>
<p>
It was only in <strong>1995</strong> that a commercial version of the internet started being available to the public, [1]in that year it started being distributed by internet service providers. <strong>This is where the world wide web era of the internet was born.</strong></p> 
<p>However, the world wide web in the 90’s and early 2000’s was quite different from what it evolved into Today. With languages like JavaScript and PHP being in early development and not as prominent as they are Today, <strong>most pages were static.</strong> That also resulted in the Web 1.0 being composed of <strong>most read-only content,</strong> with little way of users being able to interact with the website (for example placing an order online) at all. The early web was also <strong>mainly composed of users rather than content creators.</strong> While Today everyone can create an account on Facebook and have their own personalized webpage they call a profile. Back then <strong>social media was not prominent,</strong> so only people who knew how to code (which was a small percentage of internet users) were able to create content at all for the internet. (3) </p>
<p>Nowadays, most people have a profile on social media, websites can do complex back-end processes with the prominence that languages like JS and php have now, and most pages are tailored to each user that visits them, making them dynamic. </p>
<header id="3">How is a website delivered through The Internet? </header>
<p>After you type in the domain of the website you want to access in your web browser (URL), the following steps occur:</p> 

<p>Firstly, the web browser asks your device to send a request for the web page you are trying to access to your router, the router then forwards the request to your internet service provider(ISP). The request that your computer sends contains both the URL you are trying to access, as well as your own IP address, we will talk about why that is later on. The first step is now done. (4)</p> 

<p>After the request for the webpage is received by your ISP, they translate the URL you typed in to access the website (for example: www.google.com) into an IP address (for example: 132.154.1.1), the IP address is used to tell your ISP what server the web page is located in. Now that the ISP has that information, it forwards your request to that server and the third step begins.</p> 

<p>In the third step, the server hosting the website receives your request. Since the request contains your own IP address, the server knows where they need to send the response to. This response contains the code of the website, which is usually written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as any images or other media that may be displayed in the website.</p> 

<p>The fourth step begins when you receive the response from the server the web page is on. Now that you web browser has access to the code of the webpage, it renders it line by line, then displays it into the screen of your device.</p> 

<p>The process can be concisely shown in the diagram below: </p>

<header id="4">The technologies used in the Web: </header>
<br>
<div class="subheader" id="5">Hyper Text Mark-up Language (HTML): </div>

<p>HTML is the widely used mark-up language when creating the visual part of a website. Even though a web developer writes HTML code to create a website, HTML is not a programming language. (5) </p>

<p>We can think of HTML as the part that “holds” the content of a website, since it is inside the HTML document that the web developers insert all the text and media that is to be shown in the webpage. They then proceed to give each piece of text a class which they will later use to modify the looks of it using CSS. </p>
<p>The main reason for HTML to not be considered a programming language is because of its lack of programming logic. It does not carry tasks determined by logic; it only process the text you give it into something that can be shown on a web browser. Nonetheless HTML is still extremely useful when creating a website.</p>
<div class="subheader" id="6">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):</div>
<p>CSS just like HTML is a mark-up language that also handles the visual part of a website. (6) While HTML displays the text of the page, CSS as the name suggests is used to stylize and more efficiently arrange the elements of the page.</p>
<p>After the web developer writes and assigns classes to the content of the page in the HTML document, they create a CSS document to stylize it. There they can do things like changing the color, font, size, and alignment of the content. They can also create boxes to organize the content, and dictate what content goes where, and much more. We can say that CSS determines how the content of a webpage is shown.</p>
<div class="subheader" id="7">JavaScript (JS): </div>
<p>Unlike CSS and HTML, JS is indeed a programming language, and is generally the one used to determine the logic of the website.</p>
<p>Since JS is a programming and not a mark-up language, it uses programming logic to create the functions that a website may perform. HTML is where the content of a website is stored, CSS determines how that content is shown, whereby JS commands more of the “inner workings” of the website. </p>
<p>If there is any interaction on the website by the user, that input is then proccessed by JS and then the website performs a certain function that was made using JS to generate the output.</p>
